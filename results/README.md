## Reproducing results
There are Jupyter Notebooks for reproducing the time analysis and the performance comparision among the search engines mentioned in the paper in **jupyter_notebooks**.

## Test Queries
There are one thousand queries in total. _./testCases/test_cases_queries_with_complexities.txt_ has all the queries and query complexities.

## Result objects
 _ptgq_query_results.csv_ has all the queries, their word counts, query complexities, and time taken to create query trees for each. _google_query_results.txt_ has a `0` for all the incorrect and a `1` for all the correct search results.
